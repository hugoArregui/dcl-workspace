* Overview

The idea of this new version of comms is to leverage the concept of an island as a unit, and be able to define specific settings per island. By doing so, we have the flexibility to deploy high-performant services when needed, while providing alternatives for extensibility or resource-optimization. We call each alternative a *transport*.

We will support three types of transport for starters:
- LiveKit: webRTC, high-quality, low latency, needs extra infrastructure to scale.
- WebSocket: WS, simple to implement and extend, higher latency than webRTC alternatives, needs extra infrastructure to scale.
- Peer-to-peer: webRTC, no extra infrastructure needed to scale, latency increases as more peers are added to an island.


  
With regards to DCL platform alone (that is, without third-party servers), users mostly need to receive information from peers on the same island, so the transports will be in charge of broadcasting information between peers on a given island. For global messages (for example, scene messages), we will use the BFF.

* Handshake

- The BFF acts as the entry point to the comms services. Users authenticate against this service using their addresses.
- Archipelago receives (thought the BFF) a heartbeat with the current peer position and sends =island_changed= messages. This message will notify the kernel that the user has to join or change to a specific island, the message will contain a connection string that the kernel will use to connect to one of the transports defined above. This way Archipelago is in charge of telling the kernel which transport will be used.
- The BFF and Archipelago are connected as part of a [[https://nats.io/][NATS]] cluster, sending and receiving peer events.

participant Kernel as K
participant BFF as BFF
participant Archipelago as A
participant "Room Service" as Transport

== Handshake ==

K->BFF: Connect
BFF->K: Open message (includes challengue)
K->BFF: Validation message (includes challengue signed using dcl-crypto)
note right: the BFF now knows the user address
BFF->K: Validation OK message

== Handling islands ==

K->BFF: Heartbeat (includes position)
BFF->A: NATS: peer.<id>.heartbeat

A->BFF: NATS: peer.<id>.island_changed \n(includes connection string to connect to a transport)
BFF->K: change island message \n(includes connection string to connect a transport)

K->Transport: Connect using connection string

* Global messages: message bus

For global messages (that is, messages across an island, for example, scene messages) we will rely on the BFF itself, in the future, this could be moved to its own project, the point is, this is not part of the transport's duties.

#+begin_src plantuml :file comms-v3-global.png

Kernel -> BFF: Subscribe to topic1
Kernel2 -> BFF: Send message to topic1
BFF->Kernel: Send message
Kernel2 -> BFF: Send message to topic2

#+end_src

* LiveKit Transport

[[https://livekit.io/][LiveKit]] is a high-quality media server using webRTC, very efficient and very easy to deploy. LiveKit has tools for webRTC signaling, the concepts of rooms (which we will adopt as islands), and its own authentication. It also has its own TURN server, so each LiveKit deployment will have a nearby TURN server, which should minimize the cost of relay for people that cannot connect directly to the server.

#+begin_src plantuml :file comms-v3-livekit.png
participant "Livekit" as Transport
participant "Kernel" as Kernel
collections "Kernel..." as Others

== Connect ==
Kernel->Transport: Connect livekit-sdk and access_token
Others->Transport: Connect livekit-sdk and access_token

== Position ==
Kernel->Transport: Send position data
Transport->Others: Broadcast position data

== Profile ==
Kernel->Transport: Send profile data
Transport->Others: Broadcast profile data

== Chat ==
Kernel->Transport: Send chat data
Transport->Others: Broadcast chat data
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:comms-v3-livekit.png]]

* WS Transport

A simple WS socket that classifies peers into rooms (islands) and broadcast messages inside the room. It uses JWT authentication with a shared secret (generated in Archipelago).

#+begin_src plantuml :file comms-v3-ws-room-service.png
participant "WS Transport" as Transport
participant "Kernel" as Kernel
collections "Kernel..." as Others

== Connect ==
Kernel->Transport: Connect using /ws-rooms/{island-id=i1}?access_token=..
Others->Transport: Connect using /ws-rooms/{island-id=i1}?access_token=..

== Position ==
Kernel->Transport: Send position data
Transport->Others: Broadcast position data

== Profile ==
Kernel->Transport: Send profile data
Transport->Others: Broadcast profile data

== Chat ==
Kernel->Transport: Send chat data
Transport->Others: Broadcast chat data

* Next steps: Scale with multiple nodes

Archipelago should be able to register transport nodes and be able to balance islands not only in the available transports but also according to a set of owner-defined rules, in order to, for example, use LiveKit for an island in the casino and p2p in a plaza.

#+begin_src plantuml :file comms-v3-scale.png
  participant Kernel as K

  participant Archipelago as a
  participant Livekit as t1
  participant WS as t2

  t1--> a: discovery message
  note right: contains data for generating access tokens, max peers, etc
  t2--> a: discovery message
  note right: contains data for generating access tokens, max peers, etc

  K->a: hearbeat
  a->K: island_changed, since the island is around a plaza, use transport p2p
  K->a: hearbeat
  a->K: island_changed, since the island is around the casino, use transport livekit
#+end_src

# Next steps: Third-party servers

Owners may want to connect third-party servers to their scenes, such as game servers or state servers. Those servers may want to receive or publish information to/from users on a given island or globally to all the people in a scene.

Our current idea is to connect BFF (for messages across scenes) and transports to the NATS cluster, and then expose a service that will sit between NATS and third-party service to be able to subscribe and publish messages to the cluster.

** Scene messages

#+begin_src plantuml :file comms-v3-third-party-server-bff.png
  participant Kernel as K
  participant BFF 
  participant NATS
  participant Gateway as g
  participant "Third Party Server" as server

  server --> g: subscribe to messageBus.scene.<id>.*
  g --> NATS: subscribe to messageBus.scene.<id>.*

  K -[#green]> BFF: message topic messageBus.scene.<id>.door
  BFF -[#green]> NATS: message topic messageBus.scene.<id>.door
  NATS -[#green]> g: message topic messageBus.scene.<id>.door
  g -[#green]> server:message topic messageBus.scene.<id>.door

  server -[#blue]> g: message topic messageBus.scene.<id>.door
